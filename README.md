# NoPlugin

NoPlugin is the missing compatibility layer for modern web browers, allowing you to view most legacy content designed for browser plugins like Adobe Flash, QuickTime, and Windows Media Player. All browsers have phrased out the use of browser plugins, due to performance and security problems, so NoPlugin was created to maintain some compatibility with outdated/archived sites.

NoPlugin searches webpages for embedded plugin objects and converts them into native player elements, wherever possible. If the content can't be played in-browser (e.g. most Flash embeds), NoPlugin will help you download the file and play it in a separate application.
